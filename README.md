# N.O.M.O.R.E.

Network Of Minor Exploitation Report Engines

Adult men are paying to unlock private photos, videos, and chat with children on “junior creator” platforms.  
Parents are selling access.  
Platforms are looking the other way for profit.

We are done watching.

N.O.M.O.R.E. is an open-source, AI-powered sentinel that continuously scans public and API-exposed content on these platforms, detects child sexual exploitation material and grooming pipelines, and auto-submits cryptographically signed, court-admissible evidence packages directly to NCMEC CyberTipline, FBI, state Attorneys General, Europol, IWF, and INHOPE.

We never touch, store, or view CSAM.  
We hash it, report it, delete it, and move on to the next predator.

100% public data & authorized APIs only.  
100% open-source from day one.  
Zero tolerance. Zero compromise.

This is not awareness.  
This is automated prosecution at scale.
